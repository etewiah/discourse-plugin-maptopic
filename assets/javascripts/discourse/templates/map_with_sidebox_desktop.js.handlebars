    {{!-- <p>Klavado is like a reddit for places - it lets you find and talk about places in a simple manner.</p> --}}
    <p>Klavado is a new way of simplifying the things you would normally do with a map - finding and sharing places.  If you are visiting a new city, just ask your friends to create a 'klavado' of their favourite places.  You can then have conversations about these places without having to switch between different websites.</p>
    <p>The markers on the map represent recent conversations about the place marked.  You can find more conversations by searching ( {{fa-icon search label="search.title"}} in the top right menu on this page ) or by browsing this {{#link-to "discovery.top"}}list.{{/link-to}}</p>

    <p>To start a conversation, just click anywhere on the map or use the searchbox on the map to find the place you want to talk about.</p>

    <p>Change to any city or town you wish by clicking <a {{ action showAddCityModal }}>here.</a> </p>
