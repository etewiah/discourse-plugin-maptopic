discourse-plugin-maptopic
=========================

A plugin for discourse to allow posts and topics to be associated with a google map.  It is very experimental at the moment so only deploy after extensive testing in a safe environment.

An example can be seen here at [klavado](http://klavado.com/ "Klavado").
